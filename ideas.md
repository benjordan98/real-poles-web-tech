# Ideas

- Logo: Globe with the two poles highlighted
- Votes: North (yes, some button signifying the north pole) and South (no, some button signifying the south pole)

Pages:

- Home page showing a list of current polls, with login and register buttons.
  - Won’t need a poll voting page because. You can just vote by clicking the buttons on this Page.
- Poll creation page.
  - Form with poll title and drag and drop for image for poll if not default poll with be chosen.
- Results page showing your polls and their current votes.
- Log in page
- Register page

# Requirements

- User registration and log-in: Your application should support both anonymous and logged-in users, that is, some actions are available to all users, while others are available only to those that have logged-in. Additionally, make sure that users are also able to register.
  - Log in and registration a given.
  - Anonymous users can only view.
- Input validation: Your application should validate all client inputs. When inputs are invalid, the application should notify the client with a suitable notification.
  - I can do this on password security to ensure complex passwords
  - I can also do registration maybe some info like DOB, Gender, Nationality, can be verified, user-name (server side etc…)
  - Also login in checks…
- DBMS: Use MySQL (or MariaDB) and design a database that has at least three tables. The tables should be related (i.e. connected) and the database should be normalized to the third normal form.
  - Users, polls, votes…
  - 3NF I’ll figure that out
- Nice user interface: Use suitable technologies (CSS, JS, jQuery, AJAX) and design a user-friendly interface.
  - Make it look nice with Globe logo and Red and white colour scheme
- Proper HTTP requests: All HTTP requests within your application should follow the recommendation of the HTTP standard.
  - Yeah sure whatevs
